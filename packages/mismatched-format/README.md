# Nodejs Loaders: Mismatched format

Many packages are incorrectly configured, claiming to be ESM yet don't actually surface ESM. This is most commonly due to a `package.json` using the non-standard `"module"` field:

```json
{
  "name": "mismatched-example",
  "type": "module",
  "main": "./dist/cjs.js",
  "module":  "./dist/esm.js"
}
```

`mismatched-example` has told node its main entry point is `./dist/cjs.js` and that it is ESM. Therefore, trying to import this package will (likely) explode in a `SyntaxError` as node loads `./dist/cjs.js` as ESM (instead of the CJS it actually is).

This loader detects the explosion and re-instructs node to ignore the misconfiguration and instead load `./dist/cjs.js` as CJS (the loader doesn't try to find a potential ESM main entry point the package may haveâ€”there are too many options, several of which are non-standard).

Note to package authors reading this: The simplest fix here is to distribute only CJS. See [_Configuring CommonJS & ES Modules for Node.js_](https://dev.to/jakobjingleheimer/configuring-commonjs-es-modules-for-nodejs-12ed) for a thorough explanation of options.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is _not_ the same as [`--experimental-detect-module`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--experimental-detect-module): even with module detection enabled, node still believes when it is explicitly told a specific format (ex by `"type": "module"`), so it will not try to confirm it. Module detection also works only way: try CJS, then try ESM (_never_ try ESM, then try CJS).
